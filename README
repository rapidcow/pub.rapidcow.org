"pub" is a web site dedicated to (current) PUBLICATIONS.
I'm thinking of throwing homepages and documentations
in here, so that I don't have to risk having them go out
while experimenting with my REAL "www" web site.

"docs/" is the web root directory and "docs/CNAME" is read
by GitHub Pages (since I am deploying from a branch).
