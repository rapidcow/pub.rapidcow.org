"pub" is a web site dedicated to (current) PUBLICATIONS.
I'm thinking of throwing homepages and documentations
in here, so that I don't have to risk having them go out
while experimenting with my REAL "www" web site.

"html/" is the web root directory and "CNAME" is the
canonical domain name (though GitHub doesn't seem to
consult it anymore, as this seems only configurable
in my repository Settings... oh welp.)
