	<h1 id="NAME">Sort::Search</h1>
	<p>This is the home page for the (UNNAMED, but possibly "Sort-Search"?)
	distribution.  I will try to get it completed and published <s>shortly
	after my school term ends.</s> (<strong>towards the end of January!</strong>
	I'll probably also have r/perl and/or module-authors review my choice of
	name&hellip;.)</p>
	<h2 id="SRC">Source code (Git repository)</h2>
	<p>It will be hosted by the generous GitHub... here is the URL:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search">https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you prefer, you can also clone/view <a href="https://codeberg.org/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search">Codeberg</a>
	or <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search">SourceHut</a>.</p>
	<p>When I have set up and properly tested anonymous Git access
	via https / ssh / git protocol I'll put up a different URL you
	can use here too. :)</p>
	<h2 id="DEP">Dependencies</h2>
	<p>Sort::Search should run on most Perls (I put Perl 5.6
	because that's the default minimum version of <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/view/bin/module-starter">module-starter</a>,
	but I haven't really tested that far&hellip; I have
	checked that that I only use core modules according
	to corepack, either way. :x)</p>
	<p>If <a href="metacpan.org/pod/Want">Want</a> is installed,
	it would be called to determine the exact number of values
	requested in list context.  The behavior shouldn't change,
	but it may avoid having to copy array elements for the third
	argument (though this may be redundant if your Perl is built
	with COW, I haven't benchmarked anything either so&hellip;)</p>
	<h2 id="BUG">Report bugs</h2>
	<p>To submit any bugs you found (this early though???),
	rt.cpan.org won't work as I haven't uploaded the package to CPAN.
	So use the GitHub bug tracker: <a href="https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search/issues">https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search/issues</a>.</p>
	<p>If you can and are willing to write up a fix, the GitHub
	way to do it is to submit a Pull Request:
	<a href="https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search/pulls">https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search/pulls</a></p>
	<p>You can also send patches since I know how to apply them, but
	the issue is I don't have a real mailing list, so other people
	will not be able to join the discussion.  If your mail provider
	doesn't let you change the author name and email as they appear
	on the "From" header, please also let me know what alternatives
	you would prefer.</p><p>You can also use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull">git-request-pull</a>
	if you made your changes in a Git repository that is not on GitHub;
	be noted that git-pull will include the URL of your repository,
	so if that's not something you want other people to see, you
	should tell me about it too.</p>
	<h2 id="SECURITY">Report security vulnerabilities</h2>
	<p>From the current revision of <a href="https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search/blob/233453a5faa13ecdf2b0d9f300eabdd43dfd0799/.github/SECURITY.md">SECURITY.md</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>This is the Security Policy for the CPAN distribution <code>Sort-Search</code>, based on the CPAN Security Group's Guidelines for Adding a Security Policy to Perl Distributions (version 1.4.2).</p>

	<h2 id="POD">Documentation</h2>
	<p>I have written some over <a href="https://www.rapidcow.org/~ethan/FastLook.pm">here</a>
	but it's too long and unstructured for people to actually make use of it.
	<s>I'll write up a new one near the end of this month (and year)</s> (okay
	please just wait until I get back to school i really don't wanna do it now
	<code>TvT</code>) but until then that would be the best I got.</p>
	<p>There will also be a separate Cookbook/Tutorial POD for a more
	example-driven approach to these functions.  The documentation
	itself will be more focused on usage.  I may take inspiration from
	features that the existing binary search libraries lack, such as
	<a href="https://github.com/daoswald/List-BinarySearch-XS/issues/2">this issue</a>.</p>
	<p>There is also a more narrative approach that is basically
	the design note, though it is more or less for myself and will
	not be included in the distribution.  There is an
	<a href="https://github.com/rapidcow/p5-Sort-Search/blob/master/src/00INTRO.txt">initial section</a>,
	and there will be subsequent sections that cover the less
	theoretical and more practical cases you may encounter.</p>
